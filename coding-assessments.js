// 3. If you are to develop your own sorting method, how would you implement it? Given a set of integers, how will you sort them from lowest to highest?

// Answer: Possibly if I will use a sorting method aside from using the built-in sorting function of a programming language, I will probably use Quick Sort for its highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm, and it is a good choice for sorting large arrays and for applications that require fast sorting. It is also known for the approach of divide-and-conquer by selecting a pivot element from the array, partitioning the array into two sub-arrays, and recursively sorting each sub-array. Below are the implementation: 

function quickSort(array) {
    if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
    }

    const pivot = array[array.length - 1];
    const leftSet = new Set();
    const rightSet = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
        if (array[i] < pivot) {
            leftSet.add(array[i]);
        } else {
            rightSet.add(array[i]);
        }
    }

    return [...quickSort(Array.from(leftSet.values())), pivot, ...quickSort(Array.from(rightSet.values()))];
}
const arr = [...Array(1000).keys()].map((x) => (x * 16).toString(36));
console.log(quickSort(arr));
// I used a javascript Set for storing the left and right values for better performance of write instead of a simple array.Although the duplicate values in array will be removed in Set, it strongly has better performance for its writing(Array.push vs Set.add), which is recommended usage in sorting algorithms such as Quick Sort.
